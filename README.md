# CamRaff - Milestone Project 1

Here is a link to the deployed site: [Barca Tynemouth](https://camraff.github.io/milestone-project-1/ "Barca Tynemouth")

For my first Milstone Project on my course through Code Institute via UCP (University Centre Peterborough), I thought the best thing to do was to produce something I would be familiar with. I have worked at Barca in Tynemouth for around 6/7 years on and off. I had a little break where I tried my hand at Recruitment, however, this field of work wasn't for me. During my time in Recruitment I worked sourcing candidates adept in Salesforce, before moving to a different company where I worked sourcing talented individuals in the Games Industry. This is where I built more of a passion for IT myself and decided to try my hand at Developing. I found a bit of myself here and though I had no previous experience at all, I begun to enjoy working in this field and decided I wanted to make this into a career. So here is my first project. I have produced this project with only 2 months of experience overall in coding. This is just the beginning!
