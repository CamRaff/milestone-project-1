# CamRaff - Milestone Project 1

Here is a link to the deployed site: [Barca Tynemouth](https://camraff.github.io/milestone-project-1/ "Barca Tynemouth")

For my first Milstone Project on my course through Code Institute via UCP (University Centre Peterborough), I thought the best thing to do was to produce something I would be familiar with. I have worked at Barca in Tynemouth for around 6/7 years on and off. I had a little break where I tried my hand at Recruitment, however, this field of work wasn't for me. During my time in Recruitment I worked sourcing candidates adept in Salesforce, before moving to a different company where I worked sourcing talented individuals in the Games Industry. This is where I built more of a passion for IT myself and decided to try my hand at Developing. I found a bit of myself here and though I had no previous experience at all, I begun to enjoy working in this field and decided I wanted to make this into a career. So here is my first project. I have produced this project with only 2 months of experience overall in coding. This is just the beginning!

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

#### First Time Visitors

- I want to understand what the situation with Barca Tynemouth is, like opening times and location.
- I want to get a feel for the vibe of the venue and menu.
- I am interested in purchasing merchandise if possible.
- I want to be able to access and navigate the website easily regardless of which device I choose to use.

#### Returning Visitors

- I want to see if there is any new events or merchandise available on the site.

#### Frequent Visitors

- I want the option to reach out via socials to get updates on events and merchandise.

## Design

### Wireframes

The below Wireframes were created with responsive design in mind. The main focus was to produce a view on various screensizes which would maintain an overall aesthetic and appeal.

- #### Mobile

This is the initial mock-up for all 3 pages on a mobile device.

- #### Tablet

This is an initial mock-up for the view of the merch page on a tablet. My vision for a tablet view would be to have the Home and Menu page look the same as on mobile, so with the only real changes being to the Merch page, I created a mock-up for that.

- #### Desktop

Below are the mock-ups for each individual page when viewed on a desktop/laptop screen. 

- ##### Home page

- ##### Merch page

- ##### Menu page

### Color Scheme

For the color scheme of the website, I decided to go with the original color palette from the logo you can see below.

![barca-logo](assets/images/barca-logo.jpg/)

I chose the green color for the body text, as well as the navigation menu, and decided to make it so that when you hover over the navigation links, they change to red. This is in keeping with the original logo with it being green to begin with, and then red at the end. I decided to also maintain the black backround, and this allows the text to stand out. 

For the green color, I went with the hexidecimal color `#a5b867`, as this was the closest I could get to the original green in the logo.

For the red color, I went with the hexidecimal color `#d96d4c`, as I feel like this is the best match to the original logo.

I feel that these colors work well together as there is good contrast between the two, and they also stand out really well against a black background.

### Typography

After spending some time looking over some fonts, I decided to go with [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather/) for the body of the site, and [Anton](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anton/) for the header and navigation text. Both fonts were acquired from Google Fonts.

#### Merriweather

I chose Merriweather for the body text font as I think it has a very friendly and inviting vibe, and I think with the color being a shade of green, some fonts wouldn't look quite as nice in this color, however Merriweather does.

#### Anton

I chose Anton for the header and navigation text as I felt that this font had a similar kind of sharpness too it as can be seen in the image above where I chose the color scheme from.

### Images

The image used on the home page was created by John Christensen, a staff member at Barca Tynemouth. Each of the merchandise images were taken by Beth Simpson, also a staff member at Barca Tynemouth.

For the social media links in the footer I used Font Awesome, with a link acquired from Code Institute.

All of the images found on the menu page were taken by myself using my iPhone. 

### Features

The project I created consists of 3 pages: a Home page, a Merchandise page, and a Menu page.

## Credits

### Outside Code

- I couldn't quite figure out how to get the images on the menu page to show the description and pricing when hovering, so I did a quick google and found a good bit of code on a website called [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14263594/how-to-show-text-on-image-when-hovering). I copied this and edited it to make it work within my site.

### Images

- All of the images (except the social media icons, which are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)) used in this project were either taken or developed by staff members at Barca. 

### Core Content

- All of the content, including drinks descriptions, was written by myself.

### Acknowledgements 

I would like to say a special thank you to several individuals:

- Ronan McClelland - my Code Institute mentor, for their helpful and kind manner in which they conduct themselves. They have made attempting a coding project like this a lot more pleasant with their knowledge and understanding.

- Mark Nevison - one of the students in my cohort. They were always extremely helpful whenever I asked, no matter how menial my issue may have been.
